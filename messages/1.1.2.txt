Horizontal Scroll Version 1.1.2
Windows 7 bugfix

Hat tip to Kevin C. for pointing out an issue with my JSON formatting in `Main.sublime-menu`. A trailing comma was causing a crash in Windows 7, and has been corrected.  
I wonder why it wasn't erroring out anywhere else...

Also, an appology about version numbers. Despite what the log said, the previous version was 1.1.1, not 1.2.0. My bad.
